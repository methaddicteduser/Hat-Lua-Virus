# how does this work?
once you are in a map, the lua script executes automatically, it "opens" up a powershell, which grants admin perms to the virus and then the virus executes, it steals your cookies, data, and 
installs a possible spyware onto your computer, judging by results on tria.ge

# hey!! Ive used this on my main before! What do i do?
It's (currently) unknown wether if it works on actual hardware, but in any case, change all of your passwords, reinstall windows or go through an intesntive anti virus scan routine.

# how do i not get from more viruses, like this one?
dont install mods from 3rd party websites, and always check before you install mods from the official hyperbox discord server.
